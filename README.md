Research project supervised by Prof. Sunyoung Shin
Implement coordinate-descent algorithm for estimateion and variable selection in reparametrized penalized Gaussian models 
Main idea of the algorithm: Make effort to provide a efficient algorithm for numerical optimization with reparametrization and other convergent properties
In progress
